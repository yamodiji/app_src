## Architecture

The app follows MVVM architecture with:
- **View**: Activities and Fragments
- **ViewModel**: Business logic and data binding
- **Repository**: Data source abstraction
- **Database**: Room for local storage
- **Utils**: Search engine and helper classes

## Customization

Access settings through the menu to customize:
- Search behavior (fuzzy, T9, package names)
- Display options (themes, favorite icons)
- App behavior (auto-close, recent apps)

## Performance Tips

- The app loads and caches installed apps on first launch
- Search results are scored and sorted by relevance and usage
- Database operations are optimized for fast queries
- UI updates use DiffUtil for efficient RecyclerView updates
